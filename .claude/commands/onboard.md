# Project Onboarding

Review the project documentation to understand the codebase, architecture, and current state. Read the following files in order:

1. **PRD.md** - Product Requirements Document outlining goals, features, and specifications
2. **HANDOFF.md** - Current development status, what's been built, and any blockers
3. **HANDOFF_SUPABASE.md** - Supabase-specific setup and integration details
4. **README.md** - Project overview, setup instructions, and general documentation
5. **AGENT_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Instructions for AI agent setup and configuration

After reading all documentation, provide a brief summary of:
- What the project is
- The current state of development
- Key technical decisions and architecture
- Any outstanding issues or next steps documented

**Important**: Do NOT start working on any tasks. Only gather context and confirm you understand the project. Wait for explicit instructions before making any changes.
